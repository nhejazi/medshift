Description: Estimators of a parameter arising in the decomposition of the
    population intervention causal effect of stochastic interventions under
    mediation analysis, including one-step augmented inverse probability
    weighted (AIPW), re-weighting (IPW), and substitution estimators. The target
    parameter constitutes one of two parts of the population intervention
    (in)direct effect under stochastic interventions subject to mediation; thus,
    these estimators may be used in constructing estimates of the (in)direct
    effect under stochastic treatment regimes. An incremental propensity score
    intervention is implemented for the case of binary treatments while an
    additive modified treatment policy is implemented for continuous treatments.
