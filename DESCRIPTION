Description: Estimators of causal direct and indirect effects arising from
    decompositions of the of the total population intervention effect are
    implemented. The stochastic (in)direct effects are formulated based on
    stochastic interventions (e.g., incremental propensity score interventions)
    applied to the exposure and mediators and preclude the presence of
    intermediate confounders affected by exposure; these were described in Díaz
    and Hejazi (2020) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12362>. Classical estimators of these
    quantities are implemented, including parametric G-computation and inverse
    probability weighting (IPW), as are asymptotically efficient, debiased
    estimators capable of incorporating machine learning in the estimation of
    nuisance functionals, including both one-step and targeted minimum loss
    (TML) estimators. In settings where intermediate confounders are present,
    the stochastic-interventional effects are more appropriate, which operate
    by applying stochastic interventions to exposure, intermediate confounders,
    and mediators; these were described by Hejazi, Rudolph, van der Laan, and
    Díaz (2022) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxac002>. For these complex causal
    effects, only efficient one-step and TML estimators are made available.
