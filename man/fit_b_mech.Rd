\title{Fit intermediate confounder deconfounding score}
\usage{
fit_b_mech(data, valid_data = NULL, learners, w_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.table} containing the observed data, with columns
in the order specified by the NPSEM (Y, Z, L, A, W), with column names set
appropriately based on the original input data. Such a structure is merely
a convenience utility to passing data around to the various core estimation
routines and is automatically generated by \code{\link{medshift}}.}

\item{valid_data}{A holdout data set, with columns exactly matching those
appearing in the preceding argument \code{data}, to be used for estimation
via cross-fitting. Optional, defaulting to \code{NULL}.}

\item{learners}{A \code{\link[sl3]{Stack}} (or other learner class that
inherits from \code{\link[sl3]{Lrnr_base}}), containing a single or set of
instantiated learners from \pkg{sl3}, used to fit a propensity score model
for the intermediate confounder, adjusting for the baseline covariates and
the treatment both.}

\item{w_names}{A \code{character} vector of the names of the columns that
correspond to baseline covariates (W). The input for this argument is
automatically generated by a call to the wrapper function \code{medshift}.}
